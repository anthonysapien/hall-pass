# hall-pass

A [PreToolUse hook](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) that auto-approves safe commands, blocks dangerous ones, and protects sensitive files.

## The problem

Claude Code's built-in permission system can't match through pipes. `Bash(grep *)` approves `grep -r foo /path` but **not** `grep -r foo /path | head -20`. Every piped command prompts you, and one-off approvals create a bloated settings file that never generalizes.

## How it works

hall-pass has five layers of inspection, each using a real parser — not regex.

### Layer 1: Bash commands

Uses [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) to parse commands into a proper shell AST, then walks the tree to find every command invocation. If every command is in the safelist, it auto-approves.

This correctly handles:
- Pipes: `grep foo | head -20`
- Chains: `git add . && git commit -m "msg"`
- Env var prefixes: `TEST_URL=http://localhost:3334 bun test`
- For/while/if loops: `for f in *.ts; do echo "$f"; done`
- Subshells and command substitution: `echo $(whoami)`
- Redirects: `bun run build 2>&1`
- Nested commands: `echo $(cat $(find . -name foo))`

### Layer 2: Git safety

Git commands get deeper inspection of subcommands and flags. Safe operations are auto-approved; destructive ones prompt.

| Auto-approved | Prompts |
|---|---|
| `git status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch` | `git push --force`, `push -f` |
| `git add`, `commit`, `stash`, `fetch`, `pull` | `git reset --hard` |
| `git push` (feature branches) | `git clean -f` |
| `git checkout <branch>`, `switch` | `git checkout .`, `restore .` |
| `git merge`, `cherry-pick`, `revert` | `git branch -D` |
| | `git push origin main` (protected branches) |

### Layer 3: SQL safety

Database clients (`psql`, `mysql`, `sqlite3`) get SQL-level inspection using [pgsql-ast-parser](https://github.com/oguimbal/pgsql-ast-parser). Read-only queries are auto-approved; writes prompt.

| Auto-approved | Prompts |
|---|---|
| `psql -c "SELECT * FROM users"` | `psql -c "DROP TABLE users"` |
| `psql -c "SHOW search_path"` | `psql -c "DELETE FROM users"` |
| `psql -c "WITH cte AS (...) SELECT ..."` | `psql -c "INSERT INTO ..."` |
| | `psql` (interactive session, no `-c`) |

### Layer 4: File path protection

Blocks Write/Edit tool calls and Bash commands that target sensitive files. Even safe commands like `cat` can't read protected files.

Default protected paths (always active):
- `**/.env`, `**/.env.*` — environment files
- `**/credentials*`, `**/secret*` — credential files
- `~/.ssh/**`, `~/.aws/**`, `~/.gnupg/**` — key directories
- `**/*.pem`, `**/*id_rsa*` — key files

Configurable protection levels:
- **protected** — blocks all operations (read/write/delete)
- **read_only** — allows reads, blocks writes and deletes
- **no_delete** — allows reads and writes, blocks deletes

### Layer 5: Audit logging

Optional JSON Lines audit log records every decision with timestamp, tool, input, decision, reason, and which layer made the call.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) (`brew install shfmt`)

### Install (npm)

```bash
bun add -g hall-pass
hall-pass-install
```

### Install (from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonyyam/hall-pass.git ~/Workspace/hall-pass
cd ~/Workspace/hall-pass
bun install
bun run install-hook
```

This registers hooks for Bash, Write, and Edit tools in `~/.claude/settings.json` and sets up non-Bash tool permissions (Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch).

### Uninstall

```bash
bun run uninstall-hook
```

### Verify

```bash
bun test
```

## Configuration

Configuration is **optional** — everything works with zero config. To customize, create a config file:

```bash
# Generate default config with comments
hall-pass-init
# Or with the install command
bun run install-hook --init
```

Config location: `~/.config/hall-pass/config.toml` (override with `HALL_PASS_CONFIG` env var).

```toml
[commands]
# Additional commands to auto-approve (extends built-in safelist)
safe = ["terraform", "kubectl"]
# Additional database clients for SQL inspection
db_clients = ["pgcli"]

[git]
# Additional protected branches (extends main, master, staging, production, prod)
protected_branches = ["release"]

[paths]
# Block ALL operations on these paths
protected = ["**/production.env"]
# Allow reads, block writes and deletes
read_only = ["**/config/prod/**"]
# Allow reads and writes, block deletes
no_delete = ["**/migrations/**"]

[audit]
# Enable audit logging
enabled = true
# Log file path (default: ~/.config/hall-pass/audit.jsonl)
path = "~/.config/hall-pass/audit.jsonl"

[debug]
# Enable debug output to stderr
enabled = true
```

User config values **extend** built-in defaults — they never replace them.

## Debug mode

Enable debug output to see exactly how hall-pass makes decisions:

```bash
# Via env var (one-off)
HALL_PASS_DEBUG=1 claude

# Via config (persistent)
# Set debug.enabled = true in config.toml
```

Debug output goes to stderr so it never interferes with the hook's exit code. Format:

```
[hall-pass] input: {"toolName":"Bash","toolInput":{"command":"git status"}}
[hall-pass] commands: ["git"]
[hall-pass] git: {"args":"git status","safe":true}
```

## Audit log

When enabled, writes one JSON line per decision to `~/.config/hall-pass/audit.jsonl`:

```json
{"ts":"2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z","tool":"Bash","input":"git status","decision":"allow","reason":"all commands safe","layer":"safelist"}
{"ts":"2025-01-15T10:30:01.000Z","tool":"Write","input":"/project/.env","decision":"prompt","reason":"matches protected path **/.env","layer":"paths"}
```

Fields: `ts` (ISO 8601), `tool` (Bash/Write/Edit), `input` (command or file path), `decision` (allow/prompt), `reason` (human-readable), `layer` (safelist/git/sql/paths/unknown).

## How the hook decides

```
Input from Claude Code: { tool_name, tool_input }
         |
         v
   Load config + init debug/audit
         |
         +-- Write/Edit tool?
         |     Check file path against protection rules
         |     Protected → prompt | Safe → allow
         |
         +-- Bash tool?
               Parse command with shfmt
               |
               For each command invocation:
               |
               +-- Path args match protected files? → prompt
               |
               +-- In safelist? → allow
               |
               +-- git? → inspect subcommand + flags
               |          safe op? → allow
               |          destructive? → prompt
               |
               +-- psql/mysql/sqlite3? → parse SQL
               |          read-only? → allow
               |          write? → prompt
               |
               +-- unknown → prompt
```
